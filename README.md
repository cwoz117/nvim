# nvim

clone to:
~/.config/nvim

## things to rmr:
- Packer is the nvim plugin manager that we use

    `:PackerUpdate` solves alot of the on-load errors we end up seeing when we load up nvim
    
- Mason is the language server UI, google "Neovim Mason" or run the gui w/ :Mason
    `:MasonUpdate` gets new syntax highlighting updates

- Treesitter is our Semantic error service, its in beta so needs regular updates 
    `:TSUpdate` is our goto here.
